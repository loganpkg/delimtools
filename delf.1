.Sh NAME
.Nm delf
.Nd delimiter finder
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
automatically finds the delimiter character by eliminating characters not present
or that have a frequency that is not the same in all of the first
.Dv MAX_LINES
lines. The non-eliminated character with the highest frequency, and if there are ties,
the lowest encoded value,
will be chosen.
If
.Ar file
is absent then
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
Quotes are not interpreted.
The
.Ar delimiter
cannot be
.Sq \en
as this is used to separate lines.
.Pp
Upon success the delimiter character is printed.
The format depends upon the delimiter character as follows:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent
.It
If it is a printable glyph in the C locale,
then it is printed as itself.
.It
The escape sequences
.Sq \e0
and
.Sq \et
are used to print the null character and tab character, respectively.
.It
All other characters are printed as the two digit hexadecimal
representation of their encoded value (without a prefix).
.El
.Pp
Failing to find the delimiter is considered an error, and if this occurs,
-1 is printed.
.Pp
.Dv MAX_LINES
is set to 100 by default.
.Pp
.Nm
is released under the ISC licence (OpenBSD style).
