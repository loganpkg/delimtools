# loganutils

loganutils is a collection of my software. It includes the
spot text editor and various command line utilities.

Each subdirectory is its own project. The projects
share the same repository to make it easy to share code
between them.

## Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/loganpkg/loganutils.git

Set `installdir` in the `buildall.sh` file, the default is
the `$HOME` directory.

    $ m4 buildall.sh | sh
